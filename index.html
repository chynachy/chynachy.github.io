							<h3>Etsy Seller CX</h3>
							<p> Handmade jewelry is one of my favorite things to get from Etsy. I recently purchased a yogi mala necklace made of tigers eye beads and a beautiful brass charm sourced from Ethiopia.<br />
							The seller's note promised shipping within 2 business days, but I had seen no update for 4 days. Despite feeling frustrated and impatient, I decided not to cancel the order. Rather than <br />
							writing to ask about the hold up from a place of impatience, I simply chose to give it another day or two before I requested a refund. To my delight, the seller wrote to me shortly after <br />
							informing me that my necklace had been shipped to arrive the next day. They paid to rush the delivery without me having to ask. My neklace was beautifully packaged with a handwritten card <br />
						        thanking me for my patience and business. In addition to that, they sent me a free pair of earrings and a discount code for my next order. By appreciating my buiness and suprising me with an unexpected bonus,<br />
					                that Etsy seller gave me a memorable customer experience, and won my return business< br/>

							<h3>Learning By Doing</h3>
							<p>I wanted to show my ability to find and follow directions to accomplish a technical goal,<br / >
							so I taught myself about Github Pages to make this presentation for you, Basecamp. I've been lurking around cool Github repos and <br />
							interesting Codepens for some time, but didn't have a specific vision to accomplish with a Github Page until now. In the process of building this page, I've learned <br />
							basic command line terminology, and even linked my Github account to Atom.</p>

							<h3>Ackee & Saltfish, My Way</h3>
							<p>The best meals start with music, so I like to set the atmosphere in my kitchen with a playlist that takes me back to<br />
							my childhood, when I would be in the kitchen with my gran as she cooked. These days, I make it my business to<br />
							share that culture with my own family. With my saltfish soaked and rinsed, I usually get my gran on the phone. </p>
