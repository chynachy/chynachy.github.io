										<h2>My Delightful Etsy Seller CX</h2>
										<p>
										Handmade jewelry is one of my favorite things to get from Etsy. I recently purchased a yogi mala necklace made of tigers eye beads and a beautiful brass charm sourced from Ethiopia.
										The seller's note promised shipping within 2 business days, but I had seen no update for 4 days. Despite feeling frustrated and impatient, I decided not to cancel the order. Rather than 
										writing to ask about the hold up from a place of impatience, I simply chose to give it another day or two before I requested a refund. To my delight, the seller wrote to me shortly after 
										informing me that my necklace had been shipped to arrive the next day. They paid to rush the delivery without me having to ask. My necklace was beautifully packaged with a handwritten card 
										thanking me for my patience and business. In addition to that, they sent me a free pair of earrings and a discount code for my next order. By appreciating my business and surprising me with an unexpected bonus,
										that Etsy seller gave me a memorable customer experience, and won my return business

										<!--- NEW SKILL --->
										<h2>I Learned New Things Making This For You!</h2>
										<p>
										I wanted to show my ability to find and follow directions,
										so I taught myself about Github Pages to make this website for you, Basecamp. I've been lurking around cool Github repos and 
										interesting Codepens for some time, but didn't have a specific goal for a Github Page until now. In the process of building this page, I've learned 
										basic command line terminology, and even linked my Github account to Atom. All that said, I spent most of my time in the editor on Github.
