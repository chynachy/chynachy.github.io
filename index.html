												I feel my best when I can be a resource to others. 
											There's something truly fulfilling about being a vessel in that way. 
											I'm most happy, engaged, and excited when en-route to solutions that allow those 
											"Aha!" moments for people.My life is about understanding and managing emotions as I talk openly about uncomfortable things. 
											Iâ€™m living proof that one can be a straight-shooter without sacrificing kindness.

										<!--- CUSTOMER EXPERIENE STORY--->
										<h2>My Delightful Etsy Seller CX</h2>
										<p>
										Handmade jewelry is one of my favorite things to get from Etsy. I recently purchased a yogi mala necklace made of tigers eye beads and a beautiful brass charm sourced from Ethiopia.
										The seller's note promised shipping within 2 business days, but I had seen no update for 4 days. Despite feeling frustrated and impatient, I decided not to cancel the order. Rather than 
										writing to ask about the hold up from a place of impatience, I simply chose to give it another day or two before I requested a refund. To my delight, the seller wrote to me shortly after 
										informing me that my necklace had been shipped to arrive the next day. They paid to rush the delivery without me having to ask. My necklace was beautifully packaged with a handwritten card 
										thanking me for my patience and business. In addition to that, they sent me a free pair of earrings and a discount code for my next order. By appreciating my business and surprising me with an unexpected bonus,
										that Etsy seller gave me a memorable customer experience, and won my return business.

										<!--- NEW SKILL --->
										<h2>I Learned New Things Making This For You!</h2>
										<p>
										I wanted to show my ability to find and follow directions,
										so I taught myself about Github Pages to make this website for you, Basecamp. I've been lurking around cool Github repos and 
										interesting Codepens for some time, but didn't have a specific goal for a Github Page until now. In the process of building this page, I've learned 
										basic command line terminology, and even linked my Github account to Atom. All that said, I spent most of my time in the editor on Github.

										<!--- 3 STEP HOW-TO --->
										<h2>Ackee & Saltfish, Chy Style</h2>
										<ol>
											<li>
											The saltfish should be rinsed several times. Soak overnight if possible.
											</li>
											
											
											<li>
											 Scald the ackee on medium heat. Get it off of the heat before it starts to break apart. 
											</li>
											
											<li>
											Your base should be going in the pan - canola oil, diced yellow onions, scallions, thyme. Medium heat! 
											If you like it spicy, add cayenne pepper to taste. 
											</li>
											
											<li>
											Tear the saltfish apart and add the pieces to the pan. 
											</li>
											
											<li>
											After 10 minutes or so, toss the ackee into the mix along with diced tomato. 
											</li>
											
											<li>
											Turn the heat down to low simmer. After 5 minutes, turn it off. 
											</li>
											
											<li>
											Dig in! its even better with boiled dumplings, but that's another recipe.

										Hey Jane, 

Great minds think alike! We have had this request for time tracking before, and unfortunately it is not a feature that we have on our roadmap.  No need to despair!  We specify a few different third party app integrations that you can use with Basecamp for your time tracking needs. Check that out here*.

								<h2>How Do I Work With Clients in Basecamp 3?</h2>
									<li>
									Hey there Jane!

Thanks for reaching out to us, we're pumped that you're using Basecamp :) 

Working with clients in Basecamp 3 is a breeze.  The very same tools that you're using with your team can be applied to your clients.  

From the people page of a project, you'll see the option to invite a client to the project.  Add any client contacts you'd like to bring in as well.  Once you've done this, the client that you added will be highlighted at the top of the people page for the same project. 

Keep in mind that you get to choose what clients can see! There's more detailed information about what is visible to the client here*. 
(https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/261-posting-in-a-client-project) 

You always have the option of toggling what a client can see and do on or off. Check out our breakdown of what's different for client users here*. 

(https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/263-what-clients-can-see-and-do) 

We have a more detailed resource on admin and owner permissions available here*. (https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/75-permissions) 

We're here for you Jane. Let me know if you need anything at all. Together, we can make great things happen! 

Thanks again for using Basecamp. We appreciate you!
